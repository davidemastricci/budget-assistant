# Budjee - the budget assistant




---

## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Budjee is an open-soruce assistant.

It does stuff when you ask it to.

### Why?

> 1. I do love virtual assistants and I do love budgeting.
> 2. Adding items to my grocery list as they come in my mind as we can do with Siri or Alexa is priceless, why can't we do it the same with our expences.
> 3. I do want to prove mysefl that I can structure and implement an entire chatbot\voicebot system.
